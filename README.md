# Auto ML Prediction Models Using Akkio

This repository contains links to two predictive models developed using **Akkio** Auto ML, demonstrating the power of no-code machine learning solutions. These models provide insight into employee attrition and Titanic survivor predictions, built and deployed with minimal coding effort, thanks to Akkio’s robust platform.

## Projects

1. **Employee Attrition Prediction Model**

   This model predicts whether an employee is likely to leave based on historical data. It uses several employee attributes to generate accurate predictions and provides valuable insights for HR decision-making.
