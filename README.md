# Auto ML Prediction Models Using Akkio

This repository contains links to two predictive models developed using **Akkio** Auto ML, demonstrating the power of no-code machine learning solutions. These models provide insight into employee attrition and Titanic survivor predictions, built and deployed with minimal coding effort, thanks to Akkioâ€™s robust platform.

## Projects

1. **Employee Attrition Prediction Model**

   This model predicts whether an employee is likely to leave based on historical data. It uses several employee attributes to generate accurate predictions and provides valuable insights for HR decision-making.

2. **Titanic Survivor Prediction Model**

   This model predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on features like age, gender, class, and fare. It is built using the famous Titanic dataset and showcases Akkio's ability to handle complex datasets effortlessly.
